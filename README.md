# enthusiasticon_2018

"EnthusiastiCon is a conference for the programming community. We will talk about what excites us the most about programming — the strange, the wonderful, and the clever solutions to unusual problems — on a day full of short presentations.

We’re hoping that wonderful people will join us to share their enthusiasm with us or listen to what makes fellow programmers beam with joy about our craft."
